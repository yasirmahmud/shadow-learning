        "content": "Gauss's Law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that relates the electric flux passing through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n[\n\\Phi_E = \\oint_S \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\n]\nWhere:\n\n(\\Phi_E) is the electric flux through the closed surface (S).\n(\\mathbf{E}) is the electric field.\n(d\\mathbf{A}) is a differential area vector on the closed surface (S) pointing outward.\n(Q_{enc}) is the total charge enclosed within the surface.\n(\\epsilon_0) is the permittivity of free space.\n\nKey Points:\n\nClosed Surface: Gauss's Law applies to any closed surface, called a Gaussian surface.\nSymmetry: It is particularly useful for calculating electric fields for systems with high symmetry, such as spheres, cylinders, and planes.\nApplications: Used to derive the electric field of charged objects, to understand capacitors, and in various problems involving static electric fields.\n\nPhysical Interpretation:\nGauss's Law intuitively states that the total electric field lines passing through a closed surface are proportional to the charge enclosed. If there are no charges inside the surface, the net electric flux is zero.\nThis law is one of Maxwell's equations, which together form the foundation of classical electromagnetism."
